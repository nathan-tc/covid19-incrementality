## Data sources

Death data form INSEE (French Statistic Agency) : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/fichier-des-personnes-decedees/

Geography referential (commune and departement) : https://geo.api.gouv.fr

Population data time serie from INSEE : https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1893198

# Methodology

## Data preparation : 
- Collection and concatenation of yearly death data (1990=> 2019)
- Deleted " replaced with white space
- retreated  dates : removed lines with invalid birth or death dates (0,72% of cases)
- fitler death dates> 1970
- join with geography referential to assiciate commune with department
- correction of department for specific geographies (Lyon, Paris, Marseille with arrondissement code instead of comune code in INSEE File)
- Grouping by death department, death date, sex, age, year of observation

## Colonnes du fichier  : data/INSEE_deces_2010_2019.zip
- year of observation (annee_comptabilisation) = year of the yearly file where the death has been accounted for. (2019 = deces_2019.txt). Please note that a yearly file contains death dates from previous yeras due to delay in data collection at insee. All files must be concatenated to get a complete view of death for a given year. Duplicate records are already removed.
- sexe : 1 = Male / 2 = Female
- age : age at death time
- departement_deces : department code of the commune where death happend. Note that some department are not valid in the repository : 1% death in "99" departement, non significative death cases in "98" department. The department name and associated region is provided in the geography referential
- date_deces : death_date
- nb_deces : count of deceased person, grouped by (anneee_comptabilisation, sex, age, departement_code,  date_deces)

## Modélisation
WORK IN PROGRESS
- Modélisation par classe d'age et par département
- Retraitement de la canicule 2003
- redressement des données hebdo de l'INSEE pour estimer l'effet de décallage dans la remontée des information (délai entre survenance du délai et comptabilisation par l'INSEE)

## How to

To generate a pickle file ready for analysis based on the years 2010 to 2019:

```bash
python preprocess.py -f INSEE_deces_2010_2019
```

This will create a pickle file in a `preprocessed_data` folder containing a pandas dataframe, aggregated by "departement" id number. `weeknumber_year.ipynb` is a simple example notebook to see what the data look like.
